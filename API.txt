G3Lua API info:
Hooks:
	G3Lua uses a basic hooking system to allow you to edit any function in the engine and 
	run your own code. To make a hook you need to run the function "hooks:Add()" with the
	first parameter being a custom name for the hook, this is used when you want to delete a hook.
	The next parameter needed is the hook type, the current list of hook types are as follows:
	- "Engine_LoadResources"
	- "Engine_Render"
	The final parameter is the function to be used. Some hooks may have their own arguments they pass
	to the function you provide, so your function may need to accept arguments.

Functions:
	game:OpenTexture(<string>):	This function loads a texture into the GPU's VRAM. It returns an integer
					that can be passed to the next function

	game:UseTexture(<integer>): 	This function allows a texture ID passed from game:OpenTexture to be bound
				    	to a primitive shape. (Rects and maybe more at some point)

	SetDrawColour(<float>, <float>, <float>):  This function changes the colour that the next draw calls use.

	DrawBasicRect(<int>, <int>, <int>, <int>): This draws a very basic rectangle. The 3rd and 4th
						   arguments are width and height, which get added to
						   the first and second args which are x and y coords.

	DrawTriangle(<float>, <float>,
		     <float>, <float>,
		     <float>, <float>):	This function draws a triangle, taking in 3 sets of x,y coordinates.
										Works the same as the DrawBasicRect function
